# DBT Pipeline Plugin

A Claude Code plugin for end-to-end dbt pipeline automation on SQL Server. This repo is a **standalone plugin store** — it contains no marketplace. The marketplace lives in [AI-plugins](https://github.com/KavasiMihaly/AI-plugins), which references this repo as an installable plugin.

## Relationship to AI-plugins Marketplace

- **This repo** = the plugin itself (agents, skills, hooks, MCP server)
- **AI-plugins repo** = the marketplace index that lists this and future plugins
- Users install via the marketplace: `/plugin marketplace add KavasiMihaly/AI-plugins` then `/plugin install dbt-pipeline-toolkit@OneDayBI-Marketplace`
- This repo must NOT contain a `marketplace.json` — only `plugin.json`

## Key Patterns

- **Plugin manifest** is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — defines agents, skills, MCP server config, hooks, and user-configurable settings (SQL Server connection details)
- **Agents** each have an `agent.md` file defining their role, tools, and orchestration rules
- **Skills** each have a `SKILL.md` + `scripts/` folder with Python implementations
- **MCP server** provides SQL Server connectivity with 4 auth types (SQL, Windows, Entra Interactive, Entra Service Principal)
- **userConfig** in plugin.json allows users to configure connection details at install time; sensitive values (passwords, secrets) are stored in the system keychain

## Development Notes

- Do not add a `marketplace.json` to this repo
- Agent definitions live in `agents/<name>/agent.md`
- Skill definitions live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with scripts in `skills/<name>/scripts/`
- The MCP server TypeScript source is in `servers/src/`, compiled output in `servers/dist/`

## Lessons Learned (plugin-specific gotchas)

Running notes on issues discovered while building and installing this plugin on fresh machines. Every entry includes the change, the reason, and the date. Full context and conference-talk narrative: [`_Documentation/plugin_learnings.md`](_Documentation/plugin_learnings.md).

### 2026-04-14 — Namespace every agent reference to `dbt-pipeline-toolkit:<dir>:<name>` (3-part)

**Change:** In `agents/dbt-pipeline-orchestrator/agent.md`, the `tools: Agent(...)` allowlist, every `subagent_type:` in the workflow body, and every `claude --agent ...` invocation example were updated from bare names (e.g. `business-analyst`) to 3-part namespaced names (e.g. `dbt-pipeline-toolkit:business-analyst:business-analyst`). Because every agent in this plugin has a frontmatter `name` that matches its subdirectory name, every 3-part name has a duplicated middle+last segment — that's expected, not a typo.

**Reason:** Claude Code namespaces plugin-shipped agents as `<plugin-name>:<subdir>:<frontmatter-name>` when the agent lives in a subdirectory like `agents/<dir>/agent.md`. **This contradicts the official Claude Code plugins reference**, which shows a 2-part format (`<plugin-name>:<agent-name>`) in its example — but the docs example uses flat files at `agents/<name>.md`, not subdirectories. We verified the actual 3-part behavior by installing the plugin on a fresh machine and observing the registered agent name in the `/agents` picker. An initial fix applied 2-part names based on the docs example and was still broken; testing on a fresh install caught it.

The marketplace name is **not** part of the namespace — only the plugin name (`dbt-pipeline-toolkit`), the subdirectory, and the frontmatter name.

**How to avoid regression:**
- Any new agent added to this plugin must be referenced as `dbt-pipeline-toolkit:<subdir>:<frontmatter-name>` in the orchestrator's `tools: Agent(...)` allowlist and every `subagent_type:` call.
- Keep the subdirectory name and the frontmatter `name` field identical — if they diverge, the registered name will silently become `<plugin>:<old-dir>:<new-name>` and every reference in the orchestrator will break without a clear error.
- The orchestrator itself is invoked as `claude --agent dbt-pipeline-toolkit:dbt-pipeline-orchestrator:dbt-pipeline-orchestrator "..."` — not the shorter 2-part form, even though the docs example suggests otherwise.
- **Always verify the actual registered name on a fresh install** — check `/agents` or the plugin picker, don't trust the docs example.

### 2026-04-14 — Pass `mode: "acceptEdits"` on every background `Task(...)` spawn

**Change:** Every `Task(..., run_in_background: true)` call in the orchestrator's Stages 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 now also passes `mode: "acceptEdits"`.

**Reason:** Background agents have no interactive channel — they cannot satisfy a permission prompt. The builder agents previously relied on their own frontmatter `permissionMode: acceptEdits` to grant write access, but plugin-shipped agents have that field **silently stripped** at load time (it's one of Claude Code's security-restricted fields along with `hooks` and `mcpServers`). The combination is fatal: a background builder tries to write a file, the permission prompt goes nowhere, the task stalls, and the orchestrator eventually times out with no useful error.

**How to avoid regression:** Any new background `Task(...)` spawn in this plugin **must** pass `mode: "acceptEdits"` at the call site. Do not rely on the spawned agent's frontmatter. This applies to every `run_in_background: true` call.

### 2026-04-14 — Remove `permissionMode:` from all plugin-shipped agent frontmatter

**Change:** Stripped `permissionMode: default` / `permissionMode: acceptEdits` from the orchestrator and four builder agents (`dbt-staging-builder`, `dbt-dimension-builder`, `dbt-fact-builder`, `dbt-test-writer`).

**Reason:** The Claude Code plugins reference explicitly lists `permissionMode` as **not supported for plugin-shipped agents** — "for security reasons, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` are not supported." Leaving those lines in the frontmatter is misleading because they imply behavior that never takes effect once installed. They also hid the real problem (Finding 2 above) during development. Permission control now happens at the call site via the orchestrator's `mode: "acceptEdits"` parameter.

**How to avoid regression:** Never add `permissionMode`, `hooks`, or `mcpServers` fields to any agent frontmatter in this repo. Those concerns belong in `plugin.json` (for plugin-level hooks and MCP servers) or at the spawn call site (for per-invocation permission mode).

### 2026-04-14 — Remap `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_*` env vars to bare names in every SQL-aware Python script

**Change:** Added a `_load_plugin_userconfig_env()` helper at module top of five scripts: `skills/sql-connection/scripts/connect.py`, `skills/sql-server-reader/scripts/query_sql_server.py`, `skills/data-profiler/scripts/profile_data.py`, `skills/sql-executor/scripts/load_data.py`, `skills/dbt-project-initializer/scripts/initialize_project.py`. The helper runs at module load, before `argparse` evaluates its defaults, and copies `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>` → `<KEY>` for every SQL connection variable (`SQL_SERVER`, `SQL_DATABASE`, `SQL_AUTH_TYPE`, `SQL_USER`, `SQL_PASSWORD`, `SQL_ENCRYPT`, `SQL_TRUST_CERT`, `SQL_DRIVER`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`).

**Reason:** Claude Code plugin subprocesses receive `userConfig` values as `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>` environment variables — **not** as the bare names the plugin's own code expects. The MCP server in `plugin.json` works because its `mcpServers.sql-server-mcp.env` block explicitly maps `${user_config.sql_server}` → `SQL_SERVER`. But the Python skill scripts run as separate subprocesses spawned via `Bash` tool calls, not inside the MCP server, and they only see the prefixed env vars. On a fresh install the MCP tools appeared to work (because they live inside the Node server), creating a false sense that the connection was good — but every skill script silently fell back to `localhost` with no database, which in turn caused background builder agents to stall at Stage 6 with no useful error. The duplicate helper across five files (instead of a single shared import) is necessary because three consumer scripts import `connect.py` **lazily** inside their `.connect()` methods, which runs after `argparse` has already evaluated its defaults — putting the helper only in `connect.py` would not fix them.

**How to avoid regression:** Any new Python script in this plugin that reads `SQL_*` or `AZURE_*` environment variables **must** include the `_load_plugin_userconfig_env()` helper at module top, before any `os.environ.get('SQL_*', ...)` call. When adding a new env var to the plugin's `userConfig` block in `plugin.json`, also add its name to the `keys` tuple in every copy of the helper. A follow-up worth doing: convert `skills/sql-connection/` into a proper importable package so the helper can live in one place — but the import must be eager and happen before argparse, otherwise the fix is incomplete.

**Related open issue (not yet fixed):** During install and update of this plugin on a fresh machine, Claude Code did **not** surface the interactive prompt for `userConfig` fields. Hypotheses include the undocumented `title` / `type` fields in each userConfig entry, the "Leave empty to..." phrasing in descriptions, or a Claude Code version difference. Until the root cause is identified and fixed, users may need to set the config values manually in `settings.json` under `pluginConfigs.dbt-pipeline-toolkit.options` (and in the system keychain for sensitive values). This needs to be documented in the plugin README.

### 2026-04-14 — Main-thread `--agent` delegation to plugin siblings empirically works (despite GitHub issues and "Not Planned" feature request)

**Observation:** On a fresh install of this plugin, invoking `claude --agent dbt-pipeline-toolkit:dbt-pipeline-orchestrator:dbt-pipeline-orchestrator "Build a pipeline"` **successfully delegates to sibling plugin-shipped subagents**. The orchestrator running as the main thread has the `Task`/`Agent` tool available and can spawn specialists via `subagent_type: "dbt-pipeline-toolkit:<subdir>:<name>"`.

**Why this is surprising:** A research pass turned up multiple tracked issues on `anthropics/claude-code` that directly claim this should not work:
- [#19077](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19077) (OPEN) — "Custom agent as main → No `Task()` tool"
- [#23506](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/23506) — "Custom agents (`--agent`) cannot spawn subagents … Task tool unavailable"
- [#19276](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/19276) — feature request to make plugin agents callable via `Task` was **closed "Not Planned"** on 2026-02-27
- [#13605](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13605) — plugin subagents don't receive declared MCP tools
- [#13627](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13627) — spawned custom agent body content is silently dropped

The research concluded the delegation path was architecturally blocked. Empirical testing on a fresh install proved otherwise. Possible reasons: behavior was silently added after the issues were filed, the `~/.claude/plugins/*/agents/*.md` discovery path differs from the `.claude/agents/*.md` path the issues describe, or the 3-part namespaced invocation takes a different resolver than the bare-name invocation bug reports used. We don't know which.

**Full research archive:** `_Research/plugin-subagent-delegation.md` — contains every issue link, direct quotes, working-alternative architectures (skill-orchestrator, `general-purpose` with injected prompts, slash-command coordinator), and a list of follow-up empirical tests still needed (Issue #13627's body-drop claim, Issue #13605's MCP-strip claim).

**Implications for this plugin:**
- The current orchestrator-as-main-thread architecture is the right design and ships as-is. No fallback rewrite needed right now.
- **But it depends on an officially-unsupported path.** A future Claude Code release could re-break delegation without warning. Treat it like a beta-level dependency.
- Any CI smoke test for this plugin **must include** a minimal end-to-end run on a clean install, verifying the orchestrator actually spawns at least one specialist. A unit test is not enough; the bug this catches is invisible at the file level.
- A documented fallback architecture is worth keeping in `_Research/plugin-subagent-delegation.md` so that if delegation regresses, the conversion to a skill-orchestrator pattern is pre-planned, not panic-designed.

**How to avoid regression:**
- Keep `_Research/plugin-subagent-delegation.md` updated with any new issues or empirical observations about plugin delegation behavior
- Before every plugin release, run a smoke test on a fresh install to confirm the orchestrator still delegates
- If any future Claude Code release breaks delegation, fall back to the skill-orchestrator path documented in the research file — don't try to fix the broken delegation path itself

**Still needs empirical testing:**
1. Does Issue #13627's body-content-drop claim apply to our specialists? Test by asking a spawned specialist to identify its role — if it answers generically instead of from its own agent.md body, the bug is still in effect
2. Does Issue #13605's MCP-tool-strip claim apply to our specialists? Test by having a specialist try to call an `sql-server-mcp:*` tool and verify it resolves
3. Does the MCP server's `userConfig` prompt actually fire on a clean install (Finding 5 Problem B from `plugin_learnings.md`)?

### 2026-04-14 — Plugin-internal script paths must use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>.py` with forward slashes

**Change:** Every agent body and SKILL.md usage example in the plugin had its Python script invocation path rewritten from `$HOME/.claude/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>.py` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>.py`. Applied in two mechanical passes across all 11 plugin files:

1. Prefix replacement: `$HOME/.claude/skills/` → `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/` (183 occurrences)
2. Backslash normalization: `\scripts\` → `/scripts/` (162 occurrences across 8 SKILL.md files)

Final count: **187 references** to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/...` across 11 files. Zero remaining instances of the old `$HOME/.claude/skills/` pattern or Windows-cmd backslash separators in plugin source.

Files modified:
- `agents/data-explorer/agent.md`
- `agents/dbt-architecture-setup/agent.md`
- `agents/dbt-staging-builder/agent.md`
- `agents/dbt-pipeline-orchestrator/agent.md`
- `skills/data-profiler/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sql-server-reader/SKILL.md`
- `skills/sql-executor/SKILL.md`
- `skills/dbt-runner/SKILL.md`
- `skills/dbt-docs-generator/SKILL.md`
- `skills/dbt-project-initializer/SKILL.md`
- `skills/dbt-test-coverage-analyzer/SKILL.md`

**Reason:** On a fresh marketplace install, Claude Code does **not** put plugin skills at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. That location is reserved for standalone, non-plugin skills. Plugin contents are copied to the plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<id>/skills/<name>/`, and the official way to reference them from agent/skill markdown is the variable `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`, which Claude Code substitutes inline at load time. On the user's dev machine the old pattern appeared to work because the standalone-skill copy was still present from earlier development, but on a fresh install every script invocation silently failed with "file not found." In background-spawned subagents (like `data-explorer` at Stage 2, or any builder at Stages 7–9), the failure was invisible to the orchestrator — the agent completed without error and returned an empty result, and the orchestrator stalled with no useful diagnostic. This was the root cause of the user's "data-profiler was called but no profile document was created" symptom, but it equally affected every other SQL-connected specialist and would have broken the entire pipeline at Stage 6 even if the profiler had happened to work.

**How to avoid regression:**
- **Any new Python script invocation** added to this plugin — in an agent body, a SKILL.md usage section, a hook command, or a code block — **must** use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/<name>/scripts/<file>.py` with forward slashes.
- **Never use `$HOME/.claude/...` paths** in plugin markdown. That's for standalone-skill dev workflows only, not plugin content.
- **Never use Windows-cmd backslash separators** (`\scripts\`) in path segments. Git Bash interprets backslashes as escape characters inside double-quoted strings, so `"\scripts\profile_data.py"` becomes corrupted on Unix-style shells even though Windows Python accepts it.
- Consider a pre-commit or CI check that greps for `$HOME/.claude/skills/` in any `*.md` file under `agents/` or `skills/` and fails if found. This is a mechanical correctness check that catches this exact regression for free.

**Caveat — needs empirical verification on next fresh install:** We're >90% confident `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is substituted inline in agent and skill markdown body content (the plugins-reference doc says so, and `plugin.json` already uses it successfully for the MCP server path). The remaining risk is that substitution might only happen in `plugin.json` / hook / MCP configs and not in markdown body. If that turns out to be the case, the next fresh-install run will still fail to find the scripts — the failure mode would be Bash seeing a literal `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with no env var set, and the file not resolving. Fallback plan: add a `SessionStart` hook that exports `PLUGIN_ROOT=$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` to the shell environment, then change the markdown references from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to `$PLUGIN_ROOT` so the bash subprocess can resolve it. Worth testing the current fix first before preemptively adding the hook.

### General rule — test on a fresh install, not in dev

Every finding above was invisible during local development (`--plugin-dir` or direct `.claude/agents/` drop) and only surfaced after installing from the marketplace on a second machine. Before shipping any plugin change that touches agent definitions, orchestration, or permission flow:

1. Bump the plugin version in `plugin.json`
2. Install from the marketplace on a clean target
3. Run the happy-path scenario end-to-end
4. Verify background agents actually produced output, not just "completed" status
